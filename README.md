# Resume Project
* For this project I decided i wanted to do a personal resume on myself in order to show future employers my capabilities as a developer in the future once I have completed my programme. For now this is just a shell of whats to come as i dont have any initial projects to show employers.
* This project idea spoke to me the most out of all the rest as i feel as a developer being able to put a personal touch on something you've developed makes it that much more special and what's more personal than writing about ones self?

## Table of Content
