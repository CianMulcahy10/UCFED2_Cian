# Resume Project
* For this project I decided i wanted to do a personal resume on myself in order to show future employers my capabilities as a developer in the future once I have completed my programme. For now this is just a shell of whats to come as i dont have any initial projects to show employers.
* This project idea spoke to me the most out of all the rest as i feel as a developer being able to put a personal touch on something you've developed makes it that much more special and what's more personal than writing about ones self?

## Table of Content
* Project goals
1. To show off my abilities as a developer in the future.
2. Have a digutal resume that i will always have and can always update.
3. be able to develop a working frontend website that is easy to navigate and use.
* User stories
1. This website is focused on future potential employers, so as a use i wanted to make obvious of what my abilties are and what i would provide to them.
2. so as a user if i wanted to go to the home page all i would have to do is click my name at the top left of any of the pages or simply the home button.
3. if a user wanted to contact my social medias are in the footer for easy access or you can click the contact form and contact me in a more formal sense.
4. if a user wanted to find out more about me as a person and developer all they would have tot do is click the about button where i have provided personal information and in the future will have any projets i have done and feel wouldbe up to industry standard.
5. <a href="assets/Wireframes.pdf">Wireframes</a>
* Design Choices
1. There wasnt any specific design choices i just wanted to keep it simple to make it easily accessable to anyone and that it wasn't an eyesore to look at.
## Features
* Existing Features
1. the features i have so far are three buttons at the top right that bring you to the three different pages I made or to click my name to bring you back to the home screen.
2. i also provided a downloadable link for my actual CV so you can see all my past employment and seducation.
3. Multiple ways of contacting me were also provided such as my social links and a ways of submitting an email directly to me.
* Features left to add
1. obviously in the future i hope to add more eyecatching designs to the webpage itself.
2. I also hope to add more projects and more information about myself as a developer in the future.
3. in the future i hope to fix some of the little errors i had throughout the creating of the project such as the header on my about page not working correctly and casuing constant overlapping or having different error messages pop up when incorrect details appear in the contact page.

## Sources and Applications used
* w3schools
* slack
* previous course work
* stack overflow
## Testing
1. Home page
 * go to home page
 * try clicking home tab and see if it takes you There
 * try to click about tab and see if it brings you There
 * try to click contact tab and see if it takes you there.
 * click the download link at the bottom of the page and see if it brings you to a new page with a pdf
2. about page 
 * about page is similar to the home page so just test the tab at the top
3. contact page
 * test if different page tabs work
 * test if text bubbles work and allow input
 * problem at the minute is that the correct errors dont output when clicking the submit button which with the deadline approaching i dont have time to address it.
4. errors
 * the links to social media have a weird problem where their bubbles are not the correct sizes on webpage or phone size
 * the about page header has an overlapping issue when changing resolutions
